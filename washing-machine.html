  <h1>Washing Machine</h1>
  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Small hydroelectric power station to show the principle of renewable energy and manufacturing of complex turbine blades using 3D printing. The turbine shaft is connected to a driving gear as an input to a small gear box located under the water entrance channel to transform the energy to the motor shaft. </p>
  <h2>Tasks</h2>
  <ol>
  
  <li>Drawing 2D sketch of a vortex turbine blade with the calculated blade.</li>
 <li>	3D printing the first trial of the external parts with the suitable material (Temperature Based Color-Changing Filament to check for any excessive heat from electric parts or friction â€“ Transparent filament for the water tanks)</li>
